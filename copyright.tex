\mychapter{A note on copyright}
You can't actually copyright game rules. Copyright protects the implementation,
e.g. this document, but not the \emph{idea}. This game, and all games, are
therefore all ready in the public domain in a very real sense.  The interests
of the game publishers may, however, be further protected by trademarks and
sometimes even by patents, which are enforced by esoteric orders of corporate
lawyers. This may be why games these days are so strongly branded: the idea is
protected by conflating it with, making it inseparable from, and bringing it
within the magical circle of the lore, the art, the brand.

While personally I enjoy good lore and nice art, it sometimes does happen, that
the rules are good, but the execution is not, and I wish someone would
reimplement the game in a better setting. The good news is that this is
allowed, the bad news is that this is a lot of work, and that while taking
someone's idea without asking may not be illegal, it may also not be very nice.

I choose to explicitly put a CC:\CcLongnameBySa license on this work not to
protect it, but to signal that I approve of remixes, and that I appreciate
feedback. Please be creative, but please be considerate too!
